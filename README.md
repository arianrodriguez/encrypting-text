# encrypting-text
This project has been the product of a challenge applied to Alura LATAM students together with Oracle Next Education, being me one of them. 
It is a web page that allows the functionality of encrypting and decrypting text using JavaScript.

The encryptation "keys" are: 
letter 'e' converted to 'enter' 
letter 'i' converted to 'imes' 
letter 'a' converted to 'ai' 
letter 'o' converted to 'omes' 
letter 'u' converted to 'ufat'

Example: "cat" => "cait" "cait" = > "cat"
